# ReactVis

ReactVis is my playground for toying around with building dashboard style applications using React. A live demo of the stable build can be found here -> [ReactVis-stable](https://tsmathis.github.io/react-vis/).

Currently supports:
- Multiple color themes
- Light and Dark themes
- A fully functional calendar system

Future plans:
- Database features for "organization" members (ex: employees, customers, etc)
- Analytics applications utilizing the data visualization tools available from Syncfusion
- A responsive Chat and Notification system

Built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Syncfusion
